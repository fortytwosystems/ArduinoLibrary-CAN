FortyTwo CAN
===============

FortyTwo CAN is an Arduino library for connecting the SAMC21/SAMC21N microcontrollers to a CAN bus.

Requirements
---------------

SAMC21/SAMC21N support is required, but not currently available in Arduino or PlatformIO by default. See https://github.com/fortytwosystems/ArduinoCore-samc for installation instructions.

Usage
-----------------

See ```examples``` folder

Acknowledgements
-----------------

Much of the library was rewritten from https://github.com/hugllc/samc21_can, which in turn takes many pieces from https://github.com/coryjfowler/MCP_CAN_lib.
